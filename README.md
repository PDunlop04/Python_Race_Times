# Python_Race_Times
Finds the fastest athlete among list of athletes and other data.
This was the last assignment I did in my CSC 110 class, we were tasked with taking information from files containing race participant names, their nationality and their race time. We then took the information and compared it among each athlete to find the fastest race time among the athletes. This project helped build my understanding of python and introduced me to the coding world.
